Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase> who has made an eloquent case&#8212;I say this as an act of generosity&#8212;for the Bill. I must declare an interest as I am the honorary vice-president of Carers UK, and patron of a number of carers organisations in my constituency.</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/2\">I warmly congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673\" name=\"Barbara Keeley\">the Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley)</phrase> on introducing this vital Bill, and on all the hard work she has done on behalf of carers since she joined the House in 2005 and became an active member of the then new all-party group on carers.</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/3\">As has been indicated, I have a strong interest in the Bill. As past carers, my wife and I know some of the great challenges that are experienced by carers, and the desperate need for recognition, identification and support, especially for those who wish to work or return to education and training. The Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004, which had been my own Bill, introduced an important dimension to carer support services, not least by helping carers who wished to work or access education, training or leisure activities. Then and now, right hon. and hon. Members speak for all our constituents when we seek justice for carers and their families. Indeed, we are part of a great disability and carers movement throughout the country, although sadly we recently lost two of its mighty champions&#8212;Lord Ashley of Stoke and Lord Morris of Manchester. They supported the 2004 Act and campaigned successfully for the advancement of the rights of disabled people and their carers. I am sure that they would be proud to support the legislation proposed today as a discrete private Member&#8217;s Bill.</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/4\">The 2004 Act covered England and Wales, but this Bill applies only to England. It is nevertheless instructive to outline briefly what has happened in both countries and in Scotland since 2004. A measure to identify carers was included in the original drafts of the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Bill. It was dropped in Committee when the UK Minister and the Welsh Government agreed to consider alternative measures via guidance, or other measures. In England, no further steps were taken beyond the inclusion of guidance to ensure that carers are indentified. The Welsh Assembly Government, however, saw carers as a key issue and used their first primary legislation-making powers under the Wales measure to bring forward legislation on carers. That led to the successful and ground-breaking Carers Strategies (Wales) Measure 2010, and I congratulate the Welsh Minister responsible for carers, Mrs Gwenda Thomas, on her visionary work. I also congratulate the Welsh Affairs Committee, which I previously chaired, on its early scrutiny work of the legislative competence order on carers which, in a way, led directly to the Welsh measure.</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/5\">England is now lagging firmly behind in legislation to identify carers, and it is therefore incumbent on hon. Members to rectify that situation today. When the</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/6\">opportunity to frame new legislation arose, Carers Wales argued strongly for the Welsh Government to place a duty on NHS bodies to identify carers. As I said, such a provision was in the original text of my 2004 Bill, although it was omitted in the Act.</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/7\">The rationale of Carers Wales was that although most carers have no relationship with social services, all will have contact with the national health service, even if only through their GPs. A compelling part of the evidence base was the Welsh Government statistics showing that the number of people, including disabled children, with long-term conditions, frailty or disabilities who receive services from social services, made up a tiny proportion of those identified as disabled in the 2001 census. Furthermore, the number of carer assessments carried out by local authorities were, sadly, a tiny percentage of those listed as carers in the census.</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/8\">Carers Wales demonstrated that the duty to identify carers would be the most effective way of getting information and, indirectly, support for the greatest number of carers. In Wales we are on track to achieve that goal, and it is something that the Bill also aims to achieve. That is why we should support its progress today.</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/9\">Practice on the ground in other areas shows that we are not entirely without hope that such a measure can be achieved in England. Carers UK is funded in Kensington and Chelsea by the royal borough, and part of its work is to provide advice surgeries in three key GP practices. As a result of several different methods of identification, many families have found the support they need, much of which comes from outside social services. Those individual carers would not otherwise have been identified.</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/10\">Elsewhere in England, Carers UK has a link worker in Islington whose task is to identify carers in a hospital setting. Again, evidence suggests that carers are not receiving advice and information at the right time to make the correct decisions for them and their families. The Bill we are discussing wishes to achieve good practice universally across the whole of England.</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/11\">My county borough of Neath Port Talbot has the highest proportion of carers of any county borough in the United Kingdom&#8212;20,067 according to estimates from 2011, which is an 8% increase on 2001. That care is valued at &#163;461.9 million per year, which is a 34% increase on 2007. That indicates to all hon. Members the growing challenge before us; it will not go away and it requires identification and quantification.</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/12\">As I said, it is instructive to look briefly at Scotland. To Scotland&#8217;s credit, it has had legislation since the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 took effect. The first drafts of my 2004 Act were based on experience in respect of those provisions, as was the measure introduced in Wales. NHS bodies in Scotland have a legal requirement to develop a carers information strategy, which includes, for example, the provision of training for carers on carers&#8217; issues in the work force, especially for those on the front-line. There is much for the Minister to learn from the devolved Administrations of Wales, Scotland and&#8212;dare I say it?&#8212;Northern Ireland.</p><p pid=\"a.517.0/13\">The Bill is a modest and yet revolutionary proposal, with widespread cross-party support in the House.</p>",
